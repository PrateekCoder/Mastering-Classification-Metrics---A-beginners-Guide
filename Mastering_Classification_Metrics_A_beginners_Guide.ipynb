        "From the output, we can interpret the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression: The model has the second-highest ROC-AUC score (0.9424) among all models, indicating good performance in distinguishing between the positive and negative classes. It has a moderate Matthews Correlation Coefficient (0.5119) and Balanced Accuracy (0.7048), suggesting that there's still room for improvement in handling class imbalance. The Cohen's Kappa (0.4936) is moderate, indicating a reasonable agreement between the predicted and actual classes, but there's still potential for improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision Tree: This model has the lowest ROC-AUC score (0.7413), suggesting it's not as good at distinguishing between positive and negative classes compared to the other models. It has moderate scores for Matthews Correlation Coefficient (0.4783), Balanced Accuracy (0.7413), and Cohen's Kappa (0.4782), indicating that it's not handling the class imbalance very well.\n",
        "\n",
        "SVM: The SVM model has a good ROC-AUC score (0.9148), but lower Matthews Correlation Coefficient (0.5000), Balanced Accuracy (0.6974), and Cohen's Kappa (0.4801) scores. These lower scores suggest that the SVM model could be improved in terms of handling class imbalance and agreement between predicted and actual classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random Forest: This model has the highest ROC-AUC score (0.9473) among all models, indicating excellent performance in distinguishing between the positive and negative classes. It also has the highest Matthews Correlation Coefficient (0.5305), Balanced Accuracy (0.7301), and Cohen's Kappa (0.5224) scores, suggesting it's handling the class imbalance better than the other models and has better agreement between the predicted and actual classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "KNN: The KNN model has a decent ROC-AUC score (0.8767) but lower Matthews Correlation Coefficient (0.4591), Balanced Accuracy (0.6995), and Cohen's Kappa (0.4523) scores. This indicates that the KNN model could be improved in terms of handling class imbalance and agreement between predicted and actual classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the Random Forest model appears to be the best performing model among the ones tested, considering all the evaluation metrics. However, there's still room for improvement in all the models, especially when it comes to handling class imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By considering these additional metrics, we can confirm that the Random Forest model is indeed the best-performing model among the ones tested, as it has the highest scores for all the evaluation metrics, including ROC-AUC. This reinforces our previous interpretation based on just the ROC-AUC scores."
